# UdacityBertelsmman-NativeiOSFrameworksForAI

This repository contains the materials used in the presentation **"Native iOS Framewoks for AI"**, given as part of my study group's activities in the Udacity Bertelsmann Technology Shcolarship Program - AI track. The materials are:

- A Keynote presentation.
- A CreateML project to create a ML model to classify images of chest x-rays as normal or with pneumonia (it uses [this](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) Kaggle database).
- An Xcode project with a sample iOS app that used the created ML model to classify images from the user's galery.

If you want, feel free to connect with me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renan-germano/) and make any question related to the materials or the presentation.
